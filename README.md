# Multi Domains for SilverStripe
Allows multiple domains to access one CMS instance, mapping them to different sections of the hierarchy, which allows for vanity URLs. Examples:

* `example.com` -> resolves to home page
* `example.com/shop/store` -> Resolves to a Store page
* `example-store.com` -> Shows content for `example.com/shop/store`.
* `example-store.com/checkout` -> Shows content for `example.com/shop/store/checkout`

## Requirements

silverstripe/framework:3.1.*


## Configuration

Each domain is identified by a key. You must define one domain using the `primary` key to mark it as the primary domain.

```yml
---
Name: mymultidomain
After: '#multidomain'
---
MultiDomain:
  domains:
    primary:
      hostname: 'example.com'
    store:
      hostname: 'example-store.com'
      resolves_to: 'shop/store'
```

### Options

`allow_subdomains`: If true, domain matching is subdomain agnostic, so that *anything.example.com* still maps to *example.com*, the primary domain in the above configuration.

### Whitelisting

Sometimes you may have routes that should resolve normally, and bypass the multidomain filter. In this case, for any given domain, you can specify an `allow` list.

```yml
---
Name: mymultidomain
After: '#multidomain'
---
MultiDomain:
  domains:
    primary:
      hostname: 'example.com'
    store:
      hostname: 'example-store.com'
      resolves_to: 'shop/store'
      allow:
        - 'admin/*'
        - 'Security/*'
        - 'my-custom-webhook/'
```
In the above example, any URL beginning with `admin/`, `Security/` or matching `my-custom-webhook/` will resolve on any domain.

### Global whitelists

You can put your `allow` node directly under `MultiDomain` to have a global whitelist.

```yml
---
Name: mymultidomain
After: '#multidomain'
---
MultiDomain:
  allow:
    - 'admin/*'
    - 'Security/*'
    - 'my-custom-webhook/'
```


### Forcing URLs to specific domains

Sometimes, you may have a page that sits outside the node representing a domain, but you still want it to be considered part of that domain. For this, you can use the `force` option.

```yml
---
Name: mymultidomain
After: '#multidomain'
---
MultiDomain:
  domains:
    primary:
      hostname: 'example.com'
    store:
      hostname: 'example-store.com'
      resolves_to: 'shop/store'
      force:
        - 'buy-now/*'
```
In the above configuration, the page `buy-now` can live in the site root, but the URL `example-store.com/buy-now`
will nonetheless resolve the page, even though the page isn't under `shop/store`.

## Using environment variables

If you have multiple test environments, it may not make sense for you to hard code the host name in the config. Alternatively, you can define an environment variable, i.e. a constant, and refer to it as a string in the config.


```yml
---
Name: mymultidomain
After: '#multidomain'
Only:
  environment: 'test'
---
MultiDomain:
  domains:
    primary:
      hostname: STAGING_PRIMARY_HOSTNAME
    store:
      hostname: STAGING_STORE_HOSTNAME
      resolves_to: 'shop/store'
      force:
        - 'buy-now/*'
```

This way, every environment can declare its hostname independently.

## Why not subsites?

Subsites creates a parallel CMS instance for a given domain name. This module allows you to map domains to a specific section of the hierarchy, in the context of all your other pages.

## Why not "homepage for domain"?

That works to create a vanity URL for one page, but as soon as you go deeper into the hierarchy, you return to the native URL. A more robust solution is required for persisting the vanity URLs.

Further, this module is more extensible, allowing for collaboration with other URL-hungry modules, such as Translatable or Fluent.
